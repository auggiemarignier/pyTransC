"""Sampling algorithms for pyTransC.

This module provides the main sampling algorithms for trans-conceptual MCMC:

- Product space sampling: Fixed-dimensional sampling over the product space
- State-jump sampling: Direct jumping between different conceptual states
- Ensemble resampling: Resampling from pre-computed posterior ensembles
- Per-state MCMC: Independent sampling within each state

Each sampler has different advantages and use cases depending on the problem
structure and computational requirements.
